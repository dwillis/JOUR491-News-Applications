#Voice interfaces for news

One of the more interesting technological developments of the past few years has been the rise of voice assistants. Currently, you have Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana all as voice interfaces for computing. 

Two platforms -- Amazon and Google -- are making a play for the home. And news has been a substantial component of the launch of those platforms. 

But that news content is limited. And it favors broadcasters -- people who create audio content.

And it's limited to just feeds of news. Headlines. Leads. Updates. Simple stuff. 

###Let's change all that

First, some questions to get you started thinking:

* What is the current experience of news on the Alexa platform? On Google Home?
* How could it be improved?
* How could a voice assistant be used to create engagement with a news brand?
* How could a news organization spread its brand and create audience via voice assistant?
* What information does a news organization have that could be used in voice assistant context?

**So that's what we're going to do. Between now and the end of the semester, we're going to build tools to connect news brands to voice assistants.**
